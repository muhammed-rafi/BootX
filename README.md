#  BootX

A lightweight x86 bootloader project built from scratch using **GCC**, **CMake**, and **QEMU**.  

---

## 🚀 Overview

**BootX** is a minimal bootloader designed to explore how low-level system initialization works on x86 architecture.  
It demonstrates key concepts like boot sector programming, kernel loading, and transitioning from **real mode** to **protected mode** — all built using open-source tools.
